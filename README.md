# Hurricane recovery in Robeson County

Robeson County was hit by Hurricane Matthew in 2016, and again by Hurricane Florence in 2018. In the aftermath of both storms, residents in the county struggled to recover. Barely anyone in the county had flood insurance to lean back on, the first line of defense a resident can have against storms like Matthew and Florence. The average recipient of individual assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency got no more than $4,300, not nearly enough to cover damages faced by the low-income residents of South Lumberton. 

This lack of assistance and struggle to access it has left many Robeson County residents feeling invisible, and has stained the trust they have for the current model of hurricane recovery. And it’s not just in Robeson — neighborhoods, non-profits, policy analysts and academics all across the country are questioning how America’s broken disaster recovery system should be reformed as Atlantic hurricane seasons continue to get more and more destructive.
